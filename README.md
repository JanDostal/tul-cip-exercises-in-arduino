# Description

- These are individual exercises that I have been working on independently in the university course concerning designing state machines at the Technical University in Liberec
- The exercises consist of programs written in Arduino language, intended to be run on Arduino UNO boards, so Arduino IDE needs to be installed
- Exercises were submitted to Tinkercad

# Info about work process regarding exercises

- Individual exercises were being worked on between October 2023 and December 2023
- The exercises were uploaded from Tinkercad to this repository in March 2024, which was shortly after the end of winter semester of 2nd year at the Technical university
